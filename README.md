# Zenith Budget 💰

A personalized budgeting application built with modern web technologies, designed with all the features I always wanted in budgeting apps but could never find in one place.

---

## 🎯 Objective

This project was created to build a full-stack application that addresses my personal budgeting needs. It combines intuitive transaction tracking, AI-powered expense parsing, visual analytics, and customizable categories into a single, cohesive tool.

---

## 💡 Why

I wanted a budgeting app that truly worked the way I think about money—with flexibility, clarity, and powerful features like AI transaction parsing. Instead of settling for existing solutions that only partially fit my workflow, I built exactly what I needed while learning full-stack development.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The application is built with:
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite for a fast, type-safe UI
- **Backend**: Supabase for authentication and database management
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API for intelligent transaction parsing
- **Visualization**: Recharts for interactive budget charts and analytics
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with a futuristic design system

Users can create monthly budgets, track transactions across customizable categories, view spending patterns through interactive charts, and leverage AI to quickly add expenses with natural language input.

## 📚 What I Learned

Throughout this project I built comprehensive full-stack development skills:

- **Modern React patterns**: Hooks (useState, useEffect, custom hooks), Context API for state management, component composition, and type-safe props with TypeScript.
- **Backend integration**: Working with Supabase for authentication, database operations, real-time subscriptions, and secure API endpoints.
- **API design**: Creating serverless functions, handling requests/responses, error handling, and integrating third-party APIs (Google Gemini).
- **State management**: Building custom hooks for complex state logic, managing global auth state, and coordinating data across components.
- **Data visualization**: Implementing interactive charts with Recharts, transforming raw data into meaningful visual insights.
- **TypeScript proficiency**: Defining complex types and interfaces, type guards, generic types, and leveraging the type system for safer code.
- **Build tooling**: Configuring Vite for optimal development experience, understanding module bundling, and environment-specific configurations.
- **UI/UX design**: Creating an intuitive interface, responsive layouts, modal patterns, form validation, and consistent visual feedback.
- **Authentication flows**: Implementing secure user authentication, session management, and protected routes.
- **Database design**: Structuring relational data, writing efficient queries, and managing user-specific data isolation.
- **AI integration**: Prompt engineering for transaction parsing, handling API responses, and fallback strategies for AI failures.
- **Performance optimization**: Lazy loading, memoization, efficient re-renders, and debugging with React DevTools.
- **Git workflow**: Version control best practices, branching strategies, and collaborative development patterns.
- **Problem-solving**: Breaking down complex features, debugging across the stack, and iterating based on real-world usage.
